# About Murtaza Naiyar

Murtaza Naiyar is a GenAI Engineer with 10 years of experience.

## Overview
- Name: Murtaza Naiyar
- Role: GenAI Engineer
- Tagline: Building intelligent systems with LLMs, ML, and modern AI. 10 years turning research into products.
- He focuses on large language models, RAG (retrieval-augmented generation), agents, and putting research into production.

## About
He is a GenAI engineer with 10 years of experience building intelligent systems. His work spans machine learning, natural language processing, and bringing cutting-edge AI from research into production. He focuses on large language models, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), and agentic systems. He cares about reliability, scalability, and making AI useful for real products and users. When not shipping models or pipelines, he likes to stay close to the latest research and the open-source ML community. He is always open to collaboration and interesting problems.

## What he does
1. From research to production: Design and deploy LLM-based products, RAG systems, and evaluation pipelines.
2. Agents and tool use: Multi-agent workflows, tool use, and human-in-the-loop for real applications.
3. Reliable AI systems: MLOps, monitoring, and production-grade ML so AI works when it matters.

## Skills (high level)
- LLMs and GenAI, Machine Learning, RAG and Agents, Python, MLOps, NLP

## Skills (detailed)
- GenAI and LLMs: LLM fine-tuning and prompting, RAG, agents and tool use, evaluation and evals frameworks.
- ML and NLP: Machine learning (supervised, unsupervised), NLP (transformers, embeddings), model deployment and serving.
- Languages and frameworks: Python, PyTorch, TensorFlow, LangChain, Hugging Face.
- Tools and platforms: MLOps and experiment tracking, vector DBs and search, cloud (AWS/GCP), CI/CD and production ML.

## Experience
- Senior GenAI Engineer at Company Name (2022 – Present): Led design and deployment of LLM-based products and RAG systems. Built evaluation pipelines and MLOps for production models.
- ML Engineer at Previous Company (2019 – 2022): Developed NLP and ML models for production applications. Collaborated with research and product teams on model lifecycle.
- Software / ML Engineer at Earlier Role (2015 – 2019): Shipped ML-powered features and data pipelines. Grew from software engineering into ML and AI.

## Projects
1. RAG-powered product assistant: End-to-end RAG system with custom embeddings and LLM for product Q&A. Deployed with evaluation and monitoring. Tech: Python, LangChain, OpenAI, Vector DB.
2. Agent framework for internal tools: Multi-agent workflow for internal operations: tool use, planning, and human-in-the-loop. Tech: Python, LLMs, Agents, APIs.
3. ML evaluation and MLOps pipeline: Automated evaluation, A/B testing, and deployment pipeline for production LLM models. Tech: Python, MLOps, Evals, CI/CD.
